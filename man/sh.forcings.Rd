\arguments{
\item{input.object}{An R list object generated from \code{\link[shinyrAtlantis]{make.sh.forcings.object}}.}

\description{
A shiny application that displays water exchanges, salinity and temperature data
from the netCDF files used as forcings for an Atlantis run.

To run this application a list object must first be generated using
\code{\link[shinyrAtlantis]{make.sh.forcings.object}} (see Examples).

The \emph{Connections} tab displays the number of neighbouring water layers that each
water layer in a chosen box exchanges water. Use this tab to check that all water layers in
boxes exchange with at least one other water layer.

The \emph{Exchanges} tab allows the user to display the exchanges read into Atlantis
(Raw) and all exchanges associated with a box (All). Atlantis only reads in a
single exchange value associated with a pair of box layers, however this exchange
influences flow for both box layers. Use the (All) tab to see all flows
associated with a box. An option is available to plot either
raw exchange values or their sign, and whether box numbering is displayed.
Exchanges are also presented in a table.

The \emph{Horizontal flows} tab provides visualisation of the horizontal flow field at
each water layer. This flow is \emph{approximate} as it is calculated
using only exchanges at a single layer, however some horizontal flow may occur
from horizontal exchanges at the other layers. The length of the arrow only provides
a guide to flow speed.

The \emph{Vertical flows} tab provides net vertical fluxes for each water layer in
a box. An option is available to plot either
raw exchange values or their sign, and whether box numbering is displayed.
Exchanges (per unit area per time step) are also presented in a table.

The \emph{Time-series} tab allows the user to examine all water exchanges from a
specified water layer. As vertical exchanges are often much greater than horizontal
exchanges an option is available to suppress plotting of vertical exchanges.
This plot can take some time to generate so a checkbox is provided to
enable the plot.

The \emph{Temperature} and \emph{Salinity} tabs provide spatial and time-series
plots. Tabular versions of the data are also presented.
